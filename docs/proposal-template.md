# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
(Also define some loosely defined features of your project using bullet points)

Our project is working to address the issue of a general lack of energy in the morning, as well minimal exercise or incentive to exercise. With this in mind we've started planning an iOS application that would help achieve both! Our intention is to build an app that will allow you to wake up and do a quick exercise. This will challenge people do wake up and make the first thing they do in the morning hopefully the hardest part of there day in a bite sized kind of way. Whether it be stamina with a plank, or strength with pushups, the only barier to entry is a phone in hand. 

All members in our group believe that an active life improves mental well-being as well as provides are more natural way to 'start your engine' so to say. We seek to personalize the project to help allow anyone from any range of exercising background a change to train.  This is a goal we believe in individually and a goal we can achieve as a group.
